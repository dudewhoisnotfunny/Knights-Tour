# Knights-Tour
A c program that solves the knights tour problem for varying board sizes and starting positions.
The program is meant to be run from the comand line with 3 arguments.
1) Integer for the board size (board is a square)
2) Integer for the starting X index (indexing starts at 0) 
3) Integer for the starting Y index (indexing starts at 0) 

The program will print "No Possible path" if there is no Knights Tour otherwise the program will 
print the knights tour in the format of a labled grid
